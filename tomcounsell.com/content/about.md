People say I'm logical, confident, and easy-going. Secretly, I deeply enjoy challenging the status quo, instigating change for good, patiently leading by example, and enjoying the world with a sprinkle of hedonistic pursuits.

My areas of interest include inter-cultural understanding, artificial general intelligence, carbon-free human transportation systems, fixing youth unemployment, language-free mobile interface design, and understanding parallel dimensions.
