## About Tom Counsell

Tom bootstrapped his first successful startup, a social enterprise in Morocco, growing to $1M revenue within 3 years and trained up internal team members to takeover executive positions. As a leader, he balances teams, bringing empathy and a high demand for personal responsibility.

Since 2014, he has helped raise over $3M in crowdfunding and investments, sold 1 company, and scaled up highly effective IT and operations teams.

He is an energizing public speaker and purpose-driven leader that puts others first. From standing desks to painted murals, countless office environments have been permanently altered because Tom cares about teamwork environments, making them highly effective for work and startup hustling!
